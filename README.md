In this project, I am creating expandable FAQ cards that have questions and answers.

Using: 
1) CSS because I am using Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/).
  I am not putting the comment icons right into the HTML. 
    I am using CSS and a specific Unicode for these icons and then positioning them.
2) JavaScript to be able to close and open each of the tabs to see the answer.
  Need to toggle the active class on the parent node.
